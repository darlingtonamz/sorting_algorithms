This is the resource redrectory that we'll using to facilitate the Data structure - sorting algorithms class.
Please upload to Github.
To compare the sorting algorithms, follow these steps:
- Open terminal / CMD
- Navigate to this folder
- Generate data.json with "ruby data_generation.rb"
- Edit compare_sorting.rb (not required)
- Run "ruby compare_sorting.rb"

Note: You must have Ruby installed on your machine, for the "ruby" command to work.
